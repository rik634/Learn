# Time Complexities of Algorithms:


## Rough:

1. Bellman Ford (uses graph, DP is used here): used to find the shortest path from source to destination
2. Floyd warshall algorithm: used to find the shortest path between every pair of vertices






## Application:
### DP
1.	Bellman ford algorithm (used to find the shortest path from source to destination)
2.	Floyd warshall algorithm (used to find the shortest path between every pair of vertices)
3.	Diff utility (LCS-Longest common subsequence) (to find difference between 2 files)
4.	Search closed words (Edit distance) (searching a word in dictionary which is closest to the word u are searching for)
5.	Resource allocation (0-1 knapsack, suppose we have some requirements of resources and we have some options, we can make optimized decisions using this)
