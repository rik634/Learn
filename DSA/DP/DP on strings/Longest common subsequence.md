# Longest Common Subsequence
- Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

- A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

### Logic
- For any given string, number of possible subsequences is: 2^n.
