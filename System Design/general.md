What interviewers say vs what they really mean (system design edition) 



â€” "Let's start with a simple problem." 

ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s not simple. Youâ€™re about to design a system more complex than your entire experience overall with any of the systems?

â€” "How would you handle a billion users?" 

ðŸ‘‰ You probably wonâ€™t ever have a billion users, but I want to see if you panic. 

â€” "How would you scale this?" 

ðŸ‘‰ Iâ€™m waiting for you to forget about consistency, caching, or rate limiting. 

â€” "What database would you use?" 

ðŸ‘‰ Say SQL, Iâ€™ll ask why not NoSQL. Say NoSQL, Iâ€™ll ask why not SQL. 

â€” "How would you handle failures?" 

ðŸ‘‰ If you donâ€™t mention retries, circuit breakers, and failover strategies, I will fail YOU. 

â€” "Explain your trade-offs." 

ðŸ‘‰ If you donâ€™t mention CAP theorem, Iâ€™m legally required to shake my head in disappointment. 

â€” "How would you improve this design?" 

ðŸ‘‰ I hope you donâ€™t realize I left obvious flaws just to see if youâ€™d catch them. 

â€” "Any questions for me?" 
ðŸ‘‰ If you ask about work-life balance, I will deflect harder than a failing load balancer.
