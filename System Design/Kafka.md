## Kafka:

Kafka isn’t just about producing and consuming messages. It’s the backbone of scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time systems used by some of the biggest companies in the world.

Here’s a breakdown of five key Kafka patterns that every engineer should know:

1. Centralized Log Management – Stream logs from multiple applications into Kafka for long-term storage and analysis.

2. Real-Time Data Distribution – Publish data to multiple consumers efficiently using Kafka’s pub/sub architecture.

3. Seamless Log Replication – Ensure consistency across distributed systems by replicating and replaying log changes.

4. Multi-Stage Event Processing – Process event streams in multiple stages for real-time pattern detection and analytics.

5. Advanced Event Workflow Automation – Automate workflows by detecting and analyzing event patterns in real time
