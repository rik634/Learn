Caching improves performance, reduces database load, and ensures fast response times. Choosing the right strategy depends on balancing speed, consistency, and fault tolerance.

### Caching strategies:

1. Cache-Aside: The application checks the cache first. If the data isnâ€™t found, it retrieves it from the database, updates the cache, and returns the result. Simple but can cause latency on cache misses.

2. Read-Through: The cache fetches missing data from the database and returns it to the application. Ensures frequently accessed data stays cached but adds slight overhead.

3. Refresh-Ahead: The cache preloads frequently accessed data before requests. Reduces cache misses but may lead to unnecessary updates if predictions are wrong.

4. Write-Through: Writes data to both cache and database simultaneously. Ensures consistency but increases write latency.

5. Write-Behind: Writes data to the cache first, then asynchronously updates the database. Improves performance but risks data loss if the cache fails before syncing.

6. Write-Around: Writes data directly to the database, bypassing the cache. Prevents cache pollution but increases cache misses for recent writes.
