# SOLID Principles

Ever worked on a codebase that felt like a tangled mess? Changes break everything, adding features take forever, and debugging is a nightmare.

That’s where SOLID Principles come in - five simple rules that make software more scalable, maintainable, and flexible.

Here’s SOLID, simplified:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – One class, one job. Just like a specialist who does one task well.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) – Extend functionality without changing existing code, like adding toppings to a pizza without remaking the base.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Subclasses should work as expected, like swapping a tire without breaking the car.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) – Keep interfaces focused—order only what you need from a menu, not a full meal.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, like using a universal adapter instead of a fixed plug.
