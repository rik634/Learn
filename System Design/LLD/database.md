# Database

Databases power modern applications, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. Understanding database fundamentals is key to designing scalable systems.

1. Types of Databases: Relational databases use structured tables and ACID compliance for transactions. NoSQL databases handle unstructured data flexibly. In-memory databases offer ultra-fast data access for caching.

2. ACID Properties: ACID ensures reliable transactions: Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (valid data), Isolation (independent transactions), and Durability (permanent changes).

3. Scaling Databases: Vertical scaling increases CPU, RAM, and storage for performance. Horizontal scaling distributes data across servers using sharding and replication.

4. Boosting Performance: Caching stores frequently accessed data for quick retrieval. Indexing improves lookup speed. Query optimization refines SQL execution to reduce latency.

5. CAP Theorem: A distributed system balances two of three: Consistency (same data), Availability (every request gets a response), and Partition Tolerance (handles network failures).
