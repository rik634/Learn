1. Codebase: Maintain a single code repository per service with version control for seamless collaboration.

2. Configurations: Store credentials, API keys, and environment settings in environment variables to enhance security and flexibility.

3. Build, Release, Run: Separate these stages to ensure smooth deployments and predictable application behavior.

4. Port Binding: Each microservice should run as an independent process, listening on a dedicated port for communication.

5. Disposability: Enable fast startup and graceful shutdown to improve fault tolerance and reliability.

6. Logs: Centralize logs as event streams for real-time monitoring and debugging without local storage.

7. Dependencies: Explicitly declare dependencies using package managers to ensure consistency across environments.
