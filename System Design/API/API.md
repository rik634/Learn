### Picking an API:

Choosing the right API isn’t just a technical decision, actually it’s a strategic one. A well-chosen API can boost performance, enhance developer experience, and future-proof your application.

###  REST (Representational State Transfer):

- Best for: Standard web applications

- Why? REST is stateless, follows HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and works well for CRUD operations. Simple, scalable, and widely supported.

###  GraphQL

 - Best for: Flexible data fetching
 
 - Why? Unlike REST, GraphQL lets clients request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Ideal for front-end-heavy apps with complex data needs.

###  SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

 - Best for: Secure, enterprise applications
 
 - Why? SOAP enforces strict security and ACID compliance, making it suitable for banking, healthcare, and enterprise systems.

### gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call):

- Best for: High-performance, low-latency microservices
 
- Why? Uses HTTP/2 and Protobufs for faster data transmission. Supports bidirectional streaming, making it great for distributed systems.

### WebSockets:

 - Best for: Real-time applications (chat, gaming, notifications)
 
 - Why? Enables persistent, two-way communication with ultra-low latency—perfect for interactive applications.

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):

 - Best for: IoT and low-power devices
 
 - Why? Lightweight and efficient, MQTT’s publish-subscribe model is ideal for sensor networks and real-time telemetry.

### When and What to use ?
 ✔ REST → For Standard web apps
 
 ✔ GraphQL → For Dynamic, flexible queries
 
 ✔ SOAP → To maintain a Secure, enterprise-grade systems
 
 ✔ gRPC → For Microservices & real-time communication
 
 ✔ WebSockets → For Live, interactive applications
 
 ✔ MQTT → For IoT & connected devices

 1. Use Caching – Reduce Database Load

    - Where? Frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, product listings).

    - How? Store data in Redis/Memcached instead of querying the DB repeatedly.

    - Example: Cache responses for /user/profile.

2. Minimize Payload Size – Speed Up Responses

    - Where? Large JSON responses, unused fields.

    - How? Remove unnecessary data, compress responses (Gzip, Brotli).

    - Example: Instead of {user: {name, age, bio}}, send {user: {name}}.

3. Use Asynchronous Processing – Avoid Blocking Requests

    - Where? Logging, notifications, database writes.

    - How? Offload tasks to Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS.

    - Example: Send a welcome email in the background after user signup.

4. Load Balancing – Distribute Traffic Efficiently

    - Where? High-traffic APIs, multiple backend servers.

    - How? Use NGINX, AWS Load Balancer, HAProxy.

    - Example: Distribute requests across multiple backend nodes.

5. Optimize Data Formats – Reduce Processing Overhead

    - Where? API responses, inter-service communication.

    - How? Use JSON instead of XML, or Protobuf/gRPC for speed.

    - Example: Fetch minimal JSON instead of bloated XML.

6. Connection Pooling – Reduce DB Overhead

    - Where? APIs with frequent database queries.

    - How? Use HikariCP, PgBouncer, or MySQL pooling.

    - Example: Reuse DB connections instead of opening new ones.

7. Use CDNs – Reduce Latency

    - Where? Static assets, global users.

    - How? Serve images, JS, CSS via Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront.

    - Example: Load images from https://lnkd.in/dnnacRrU.

8. Implement an API Gateway – Offload Security & Routing

    - Where? Microservices architectures.

    - How? Use Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway.

    - Example: Route /api/users → User Service, /api/orders → Order Service.

9. Avoid Overfetching & Underfetching – Fetch Only Needed Data

    - Where? APIs for dynamic frontends (React, Vue, Mobile).

    - How? Use GraphQL to request only required fields.

    - Example: Fetch only {name, email} instead of the full user object.
