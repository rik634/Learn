### Picking an API:

Choosing the right API isn’t just a technical decision, actually it’s a strategic one. A well-chosen API can boost performance, enhance developer experience, and future-proof your application.

###  REST (Representational State Transfer):

- Best for: Standard web applications

- Why? REST is stateless, follows HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and works well for CRUD operations. Simple, scalable, and widely supported.

###  GraphQL

 - Best for: Flexible data fetching
 
 - Why? Unlike REST, GraphQL lets clients request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Ideal for front-end-heavy apps with complex data needs.

###  SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

 - Best for: Secure, enterprise applications
 
 - Why? SOAP enforces strict security and ACID compliance, making it suitable for banking, healthcare, and enterprise systems.

### gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call):

- Best for: High-performance, low-latency microservices
 
- Why? Uses HTTP/2 and Protobufs for faster data transmission. Supports bidirectional streaming, making it great for distributed systems.

### WebSockets:

 - Best for: Real-time applications (chat, gaming, notifications)
 
 - Why? Enables persistent, two-way communication with ultra-low latency—perfect for interactive applications.

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):

 - Best for: IoT and low-power devices
 
 - Why? Lightweight and efficient, MQTT’s publish-subscribe model is ideal for sensor networks and real-time telemetry.

### When and What to use ?
 ✔ REST → For Standard web apps
 
 ✔ GraphQL → For Dynamic, flexible queries
 
 ✔ SOAP → To maintain a Secure, enterprise-grade systems
 
 ✔ gRPC → For Microservices & real-time communication
 
 ✔ WebSockets → For Live, interactive applications
 
 ✔ MQTT → For IoT & connected devices
