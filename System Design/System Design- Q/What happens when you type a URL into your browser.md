## What happens when you type a URL into your browser?

1. Browser parses the URL 
 - The browser identifies the components: scheme (https), domain (example. com), and path (/hello-world). 

2. DNS lookup 
 - The browser checks its cache or queries a DNS resolver (ISP or public DNS like Googleâ€™s 8.8.8.8) to translate the domain name into an IP address. 
 - If not cached, the resolver performs a recursive DNS lookup, contacting root, TLD, and authoritative name servers.

3. Establishing a connection 
 - A TCP connection is initiated between the browser and the server at the resolved IP address. 
 - If the URL uses HTTPS, a TLS handshake is performed to encrypt the connection.

4. Sending the HTTP request 
 - The browser sends an HTTP request with details like method (GET/POST), headers (e.g., User-Agent), and optional body data. 
 - Example: GET /hello-world HTTP/1.1. 

5. Server processes the request 
 - The server identifies the resource from the request path and processes it. 
 - For dynamic content, the server might query a database, run application logic, and generate the response on the fly.

6. Returning the response 
 - The server responds with: 
 - Status Line: Indicates success or failure (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found). 
 - Headers: Metadata like Content-Type (e.g., text/html) and caching instructions. 
 - Body: The requested content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or image data).

7. Browser renders the content 
 - The browser parses the HTML and makes additional requests for linked resources (e.g., CSS, JS, images). 
 - Resources are rendered progressively, and JavaScript is executed to enhance interactivity. 

8. Caching and Optimization 
 - Browsers cache resources based on headers like Cache-Control. 
 - CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and edge servers may serve static content to reduce latency. 

 Key Points for additional benefit:
- Mention DNS caching at various layers (browser, OS, ISP). 
- Highlight the TLS handshake and its role in securing HTTPS connections. 
- Discuss CDNs and how they improve performance. 
- Touch on asynchronous resource loading (e.g., defer or async for scripts). 
- Bring up response codes and their significance (e.g., '200', '301', '503').
