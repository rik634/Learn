# System Design of Coffee Shop

## Problem statement:
Design a coffee shop system that can efficiently handle orders, manage resources like espresso machines, scale for peak hours, and notify customers once their coffee is ready.

## Solution:

it touches on so many core system design principles. 
 1. The Cashier: The API Gateway  
The cashier in this analogy is your API layer. When a customer walks in, they give their order to the cashier, who returns an order number—this is your request-response cycle. The cashier doesn't process the order directly but manages the flow of data between the customer and the backend (the barista team).

- API Design:  
  - POST /order: Takes the customer’s request and returns a short URL with an order ID.  
  - GET /order/{order_id}: Allows customers to track the status of their order.

 2. The Queue: FIFO Task Management  
Once the customer places the order, it's put into a queue. The queue is processed in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) fashion, ensuring fairness. Baristas work on orders sequentially, but the time to process each order varies depending on the coffee type.

This is where we get to task prioritization and dynamic queue management. The goal here is to maintain a balanced workload across the barista team. We can't let one barista get stuck with all the complex orders while another sits idle.

- Problem: What if the queue grows too long, especially during peak hours?  
- Solution: This calls for load balancing—use algorithms like round-robin or least-loaded worker to ensure a fair distribution of tasks. Also, consider adding task retries in case a barista is unavailable to process a task due to hardware failure.

 3. Scalability: Handling the Rush Hour  
Now, imagine the coffee shop is located in a busy part of the city. Rush hour hits, and demand spikes. During normal hours, one or two baristas can handle the flow, but during peak hours, you need to scale efficiently.

- Solution: This is where horizontal scaling comes into play. Instead of just relying on one espresso machine (single point of failure), you spin up additional machines (or workers). As demand spikes, more baristas are added to the process, and tasks are distributed dynamically across multiple resources.

- You also have to manage worker synchronization: How do you ensure all baristas are working in harmony? This is where event-driven architecture comes into play, each barista listens for incoming tasks and processes them independently but consistently.

 4. Resource Management: Limited Espresso Machines  
Here’s the kicker: Espresso machines are finite resources. There’s a limit to how many cups they can make per minute. Similarly, in a distributed system, you have limited database connections, memory, and CPU time.

- Bottleneck Problem: With too many orders and too few machines, the system bottlenecks. This causes delays in processing and increases latency.  
- Solution: You need a resource manager that allocates espresso machines (like how databases allocate connections). As demand grows, consider backpressure mechanisms to ensure resources are used efficiently without overloading the system.

 5. Notification Systems: Push vs Polling  
Finally, let's talk about the customer experience. Instead of customers asking the cashier repeatedly, “Is my coffee ready yet?”, a better approach is a push-based notification system.

- When the coffee is ready, the system sends a notification (push) to the customer, letting them know it’s time to pick up their order.  
- This avoids the polling problem (where customers repeatedly check for updates), reducing unnecessary load on the system and improving user experience.

 6. Fault Tolerance: Coffee Machines Break, Too  
A critical part of system design is fault tolerance. The espresso machine may break down, a barista might call in sick, or the API layer might fail. How do you design the system to recover gracefully?

- Solution: Implement redundancy in both hardware (backup machines) and processes (retry logic for API calls). Baristas can be trained to rotate jobs, so no one person becomes a single point of failure.

►  TL;DR: Coffee Shop as a Distributed System

- API Layer (Cashier): Manages incoming requests and returns order confirmations.  
- Queue: Processes orders in FIFO order, but each task has a different processing time.  
- Scalability: Use horizontal scaling to manage peak demand.  
- Resource Management: Espresso machines are limited; consider backpressure and efficient allocation.  
- Push Notifications: Avoid polling by notifying customers when their coffee is ready.  
- Fault Tolerance: Design for redundancy and graceful recovery.
