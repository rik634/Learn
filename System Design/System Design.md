## System Design

System design is key to building scalable, reliable, and efficient applications. Let's look at a breakdown of essential concepts:

1. Fundamentals of System Design:

   Scalability, availability, and reliability ensure systems can handle growth and maintain performance. Latency, throughput, and the CAP theorem define system trade-offs.

2. Load Balancing:

   Techniques like round robin, least connections, and consistent hashing distribute traffic efficiently across servers to optimize performance.

3. Databases:

   SQL is structured and ACID-compliant, while NoSQL is flexible and scalable. Scaling strategies include vertical scaling, sharding, and replication.

4. Message Queues & Event-Driven Systems:

   Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Pub/Sub models enable asynchronous communication for high-throughput and real-time processing.

5. Caching Strategies:

   Write-through and write-back caching improve data access speed, while eviction policies like LRU, LFU, and FIFO manage cache efficiency.

6. API & Communication:

   REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSockets facilitate data exchange and real-time communication between distributed systems.

## Essential concepts, scalability, and performance explained;

Every high-performing system follows a set of essential principles that make it secure, scalable, and resilient. Let’s explore them:

1. Observability & Monitoring – Like having a control room for your system, with logging, tracing, and real-time monitoring using tools like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry.

2. Security & Compliance – Protecting data with encryption, API authentication, and zero-trust architecture to keep systems secure.

3. Distributed Systems – The backbone of large-scale applications. Caching, message queues, and leader election mechanisms keep everything running smoothly.

4. High Availability & Fault Tolerance – Backup strategies that ensure systems stay up even when failures happen, using failovers, redundancy, and disaster recovery.

5. Microservices & Architecture – From REST vs. gRPC to service discovery and circuit breakers, these patterns help prevent cascading failures and improve flexibility.

6. Database Design – Choosing between SQL and NoSQL, data partitioning, replication, and consistency trade-offs to optimize performance.

7. Scalability & Performance – Load balancing, caching, and auto-scaling ensure that systems can grow without breaking.

Building a robust system isn’t just about writing code—it’s about designing for scale, security, and reliability.

## Algorithms:

These 7 key algorithms play a crucial role in designing robust distributed systems.

1. Merkle Tree – A hash-based structure that verifies data integrity and consistency in large datasets.

2. Consistent Hashing – Reduces rehashing when nodes join or leave a system, ensuring stability.

3. Read Repair – Automatically fixes missing or inconsistent data in distributed databases.

4. Gossip Protocol – A decentralized communication model that spreads data efficiently across nodes.

5. Bloom Filter – A space-efficient data structure that checks membership, allowing false positives but no false negatives.

6. Heartbeat – A periodic signal that ensures availability and detects failures in real-time.

7. CAP/PACELC Theorem – Explains trade-offs between consistency, availability, partition tolerance, and latency in distributed systems.
