## System Design

System design is key to building scalable, reliable, and efficient applications. Let's look at a breakdown of essential concepts:

1. Fundamentals of System Design:

   Scalability, availability, and reliability ensure systems can handle growth and maintain performance. Latency, throughput, and the CAP theorem define system trade-offs.

2. Load Balancing:

   Techniques like round robin, least connections, and consistent hashing distribute traffic efficiently across servers to optimize performance.

3. Databases:

   SQL is structured and ACID-compliant, while NoSQL is flexible and scalable. Scaling strategies include vertical scaling, sharding, and replication.

4. Message Queues & Event-Driven Systems:

   Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Pub/Sub models enable asynchronous communication for high-throughput and real-time processing.

5. Caching Strategies:

   Write-through and write-back caching improve data access speed, while eviction policies like LRU, LFU, and FIFO manage cache efficiency.

6. API & Communication:

   REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSockets facilitate data exchange and real-time communication between distributed systems.
